    Explanation:
    This script simulates the process and workflow involved in the authentication and data retrieval process.
    It helps you to print out the contents of relevant files that are crucial in understanding and debugging
    the application's API interactions and overall workflow.

    Steps Involved in the Process:
    1. Authentication Request:
       - The client sends a POST request to the /api/auth/token endpoint with the client credentials.
       - The server handles the request, encodes the credentials, and sends a request to the Tekmetric API
         to obtain an access token.
       - The server stores the access token in Redis.

    2. Data Retrieval Request:
       - The client sends a GET request to the /appointments endpoint with the access token.
       - The server retrieves the access token from Redis and uses it to authenticate the request to the
         Tekmetric API.
       - The server fetches the appointment data from the Tekmetric API and returns it to the client.

    Relevant Files and Their Contents:
    - backend/routes/authRoutes.js: Handles authentication requests.
    - backend/routes/dataRoutes.js: Handles data retrieval requests.
    - backend/server.js: Sets up the server and routes.
    - backend/utils/redisClient.js: Manages Redis client for storing and retrieving context.
    - backend/utils/commandParser.js: Parses commands to map to API endpoints.
    - test_flow.py: Simulates the authentication and data retrieval process.
    - components/chat/chat-gpt-assistant.tsx: Frontend component for chat interactions.
    - components/messages/message.tsx: Frontend component for displaying messages.

    Running the Commands:
    - The 'cat' commands will print out the contents of these files in the terminal for easy debugging and review.

    ### Updated Blueprint

    #### 1. Define Application Goals and Requirements

    **Goals:**
    - Enable mechanics to interact with the Tekmetrics API using natural language.
    - Provide real-time information retrieval and updates via voice commands.
    - Maintain conversation context for improved interactions.

    **Requirements:**
    - GPT-4 for natural language processing and understanding.
    - Tekmetrics API integration for data retrieval and updates.
    - Tablet or mobile device compatibility for mechanics.
    - Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms.

    #### 2. System Architecture

    **Client Application:**
    - **Platform:** Tablet/Mobile app.
    - **Frontend:** React Native for cross-platform compatibility.
    - **Backend:** Node.js for handling API requests and processing.
    - **Voice Interaction:** Integration with a speech recognition library (e.g., Web Speech API, Azure Speech Services).

    **Server-Side Components:**
    - **API Gateway:** Manages requests between the client application and Tekmetrics API.
    - **Authentication Service:** OAuth 2.0 for secure access token management.
    - **Data Processing:** Middleware to handle data formatting and validation.
    - **Persistent Storage:** For storing conversation context and user preferences using Redis.

    #### 3. Application Flow

    **User Authentication:**
    - Mechanics log in using secure credentials.
    - OAuth 2.0 handles token generation and management.

    **Voice Command Processing:**
    - Mechanics issue voice commands.
    - Speech recognition converts voice to text.
    - Text input is sent to GPT-4 for processing.

    **Natural Language Understanding:**
    - GPT-4 interprets the command, maintaining context.
    - Determines the appropriate action (e.g., retrieve vehicle data, update job status).

    **API Interaction:**
    - Backend makes requests to the Tekmetrics API.
    - Handles GET, POST, PATCH operations as required.
    - Formats response data for presentation.

    **Response Delivery:**
    - Processed data is converted to voice output.
    - Response is provided to the mechanic via the app interface.

    #### 4. Command Mapping

    **Commands:**
    - **Retrieve Vehicle Information:**
      - Command: "Get vehicle details for VIN {vin}"
      - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/vehicles`
    - **Create Vehicle:**
      - Command: "Add a new vehicle with details {details}"
      - Endpoint: `POST /api/v1/vehicles`
    - **Update Vehicle:**
      - Command: "Update vehicle with ID {id} to color {color}"
      - Endpoint: `PATCH /api/v1/vehicles/{id}`
    - **Retrieve Jobs:**
      - Command: "List all jobs in the shop"
      - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/canned-jobs`
    - **Update Job Status:**
      - Command: "Change status of job ID {id} to {status}"
      - Endpoint: `PATCH /api/v1/jobs/{id}`
    - **Retrieve Customers:**
      - Command: "Get customer details for ID {customerId}"
      - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/customers`
    - **Retrieve Appointments:**
      - Command: "What are my appointments today?"
      - Endpoint: `GET /api/v1/appointments`

    #### 5. Development Plan

    **Initial Setup:**
    - Set up development environment.
    - Configure authentication and authorization (OAuth 2.0).

    **Frontend Development:**
    - Build the React Native application.
    - Implement voice recognition and text-to-speech features.
    - Design intuitive UI for mechanics.

    **Backend Development:**
    - Implement API gateway to interact with Tekmetrics API.
    - Develop middleware for data processing and validation.
    - Create endpoints for managing vehicles, jobs, and customers.

    **Integration:**
    - Integrate GPT-4 for natural language understanding.
    - Ensure seamless interaction between the frontend and backend.
    - Implement conversation context management using Redis.

    **Testing and Debugging:**
    - Conduct unit and integration tests.
    - Perform user acceptance testing with mechanics.
    - Debug and resolve issues.

    **Deployment:**
    - Deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure).
    - Monitor performance and make necessary adjustments.

    **Maintenance and Updates:**
    - Regularly update the application with new features and improvements.
    - Ensure compliance with security best practices.

    #### 6. Security Considerations

    - **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
    - **Access Control:** Implement role-based access control (RBAC).
    - **API Security:** Use HTTPS for secure communication.
    - **Token Management:** Regularly refresh and manage access tokens.

    #### 7. Scalability and Performance

    - **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers.
    - **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
    - **Monitoring:** Use monitoring tools to track performance and detect issues.

    ### Context Management and Enhancements

    #### 8. Context Management

    **Contextual Understanding:**
    - GPT-4 has built-in capabilities to maintain context within a conversation. This includes remembering previous interactions and referencing them appropriately.

    **Example:**
    - Mechanic: "What's my next appointment?"
    - AI: "Your next appointment is with John Doe for a Toyota Camry at 10:00 AM."
    - Mechanic: "What's the issue with his car?"
    - AI: "The reported issue is a faulty brake system."

    **Implementation:**
    - **Persistent Storage:** Store the context of the conversation in a temporary storage system, such as Redis.
