    Explanation:
    This script simulates the process and workflow involved in the authentication and data retrieval process.
    It helps you to print out the contents of relevant files that are crucial in understanding and debugging
    the application's API interactions and overall workflow.

    Steps Involved in the Process:
    1. Authentication Request:
       - The client sends a POST request to the /api/auth/token endpoint with the client credentials.
       - The server handles the request, encodes the credentials, and sends a request to the Tekmetric API
         to obtain an access token.
       - The server stores the access token in Redis.

    2. Data Retrieval Request:
       - The client sends a GET request to the /appointments endpoint with the access token.
       - The server retrieves the access token from Redis and uses it to authenticate the request to the
         Tekmetric API.
       - The server fetches the appointment data from the Tekmetric API and returns it to the client.

    Relevant Files and Their Contents:
    - backend/routes/authRoutes.js: Handles authentication requests.
    - backend/routes/dataRoutes.js: Handles data retrieval requests.
    - backend/server.js: Sets up the server and routes.
    - backend/utils/redisClient.js: Manages Redis client for storing and retrieving context.
    - backend/utils/commandParser.js: Parses commands to map to API endpoints.
    - test_flow.py: Simulates the authentication and data retrieval process.
    - components/chat/chat-gpt-assistant.tsx: Frontend component for chat interactions.
    - components/messages/message.tsx: Frontend component for displaying messages.

    Running the Commands:
    - The 'cat' commands will print out the contents of these files in the terminal for easy debugging and review.

Token Management: Regularly refresh and manage access tokens.
Scalability and Performance
Load Balancing: Distribute traffic across multiple servers.
Caching: Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.
Monitoring: Use monitoring tools to track performance and detect issues.
Context Management and Enhancements
Context Management
Contextual Understanding:
GPT-4 has built-in capabilities to maintain context within a conversation. This includes remembering previous interactions and referencing them appropriately.
Example:
Mechanic: "What's my next appointment?"
AI: "Your next appointment is with John Doe for a Toyota Camry at 10:00 AM."
Mechanic: "What's the issue with his car?"
AI: "The reported issue is a faulty brake system."
Implementation:
Persistent Storage: Store the context of the conversation in a temporary storage system, such as Redis.
js
Copy code
const redis = require('redis');

const client = redis.createClient({
    url: 'redis://default:RBD551bhnvqL0JQr1Hsf4WCZf1V5oUbg@redis-19550.c228.us-central1-1.gce.redns.redis-cloud.com:19550'
});

client.on('error', (err) => console.log('Redis Client Error', err));

client.connect();

function storeContext(userId, context) {
    client.hmset(`user:${userId}:context`, context, (err, res) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error('Error storing context:', err);
        } else {
            console.log('Context stored successfully:', res);
        }
    });
}

function getContext(userId, callback) {
    client.hgetall(`user:${userId}:context`, (err, res) => {
        if (err) {
            console.error('Error retrieving context:', err);
            callback(err, null);
        } else {
            console.log('Context retrieved successfully:', res);
            callback(null, res);
        }
    });
}

module.exports = { storeContext, getContext };

In server.js, you can create routes for storing and retrieving context:
js
Copy code
// backend/server.js
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const { storeContext, getContext } = require('./utils/redisClient');
const authRoutes = require('./routes/authRoutes');
const dataRoutes = require('./routes/dataRoutes');

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.json());

app.use('/auth', authRoutes);
app.use('/api', dataRoutes);

// Redis context management routes
app.post('/store-context', (req, res) => {
    const { userId, context } = req.body;
    storeContext(userId, context);
    res.status(200).send('Context stored successfully');
});

app.get('/get-context/:userId', (req, res) => {
    const userId = req.params.userId;
    getContext(userId, (err, context) => {
        if (err) {
            res.status(500).send('Error retrieving context');
        } else {
            res.status(200).json(context);
        }
    });
});

app.listen(3001, () => {
    console.log('Server running on port 3001');
});

Customer Search Implementation
To incorporate the customer search functionality into your application, follow these steps:
API Endpoint and Script
API Endpoint: Use the following curl command to search for a specific customer by name.
bash
Copy code
curl --location 'https://sandbox.tekmetric.com/api/v1/customers?shop=238&search=Jeff&page=0&size=100' \
--header 'Authorization: Bearer 1c39b602-682c-4100-a7eb-029863bdd191'

Filter the Results: Use a script to filter the customer details programmatically.
bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

shopId=238
accessToken="1c39b602-682c-4100-a7eb-029863bdd191"
page=0
pageSize=100

response=$(curl -s --location "https://sandbox.tekmetric.com/api/v1/customers?shop=$shopId&search=Jeff&page=$page&size=$pageSize" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $accessToken")

customer=$(echo "$response" | jq '.content[] | select(.lastName == "Sperandeo" and .firstName == "Jeff")')

if [ -n "$customer" ]; then
    echo "Customer found:"
    echo "$customer"
else
    echo "Customer not found"
fi

Save the script as find_customer.sh, make it executable, and run it:
bash
Copy code
chmod +x find_customer.sh
./find_customer.sh
